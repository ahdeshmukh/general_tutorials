INSTALL ECLIPSE ON UBUNTU (16.04)

First make sure java is installed. Inside a terminal type java -version. If it is not installed, we will get an error saying java not found. If it is installed, we will get output like openjdk version "1.8.0_91" and some other info

If java is not installed, install it (basically install jdk) using
sudo apt-get install oracle-javaX-installer (where X => latest version). for ubuntu 16.04 on 8/14/2016, I ran sudo apt-get install oracle-java8-installer

After we install Java, we can proceed with installation of eclipse

Find if your system is 32 bit or 64 bit by running uname -i
if out is 686 it is 32 bit. if output is x86_64 it is 64 bit. At the time of writing this tutorial, my system was 32 bit
Other simple way is press windows key, type Details, select Details, Read OS type field

Since I have 32 bit system, I downloaded Eclipse for 32 bit Ubuntu
wget http://eclipse.mirror.rafal.ca/technology/epp/downloads/release/neon/R/eclipse-php-neon-R-linux-gtk.tar.gz

After downloading run the following commands

sudo mv eclipse-php-neon-R-linux-gtk.tar.gz /opt/
cd /opt/
sudo tar -xvf eclipse-php-neon-R-linux-gtk.tar.gz
sudo chown -R $USER:$USER eclipse (optional)
sudo vi /usr/share/applications/eclipse.desktop
Copy and paste the following in eclipse.desktop
[Desktop Entry]
Name=Eclipse
Type=Application
Exec=/opt/eclipse/eclipse
Terminal=false
Icon=/opt/eclipse/icon.xpm
Comment=Integrated Development Environment
NoDisplay=false
Categories=Development;IDE;
Name[en]=eclipse.desktop

cd /usr/local/bin/
sudo ln -s /opt/eclipse/eclipse

Congrats - if everything runs well, eclipse will be successfully installed
