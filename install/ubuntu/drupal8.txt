create database.
I created a new user drupal8 with password 8, then created a database called drupal8 and granted all privileges on drupal8 database to drupal8 user by running
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON drupal8.* TO 'drupal8'@'localhost'


sudo apt install drush # install drush
cd /var/www/html
sudo mkdir drupal8
chown -R amit:amit drupal8
cd drupal8
drush dl drupal-8
mv mv drupal-8.*/* .
rm -rf drupal-8.*
cd sites/default
cp default.settings.php settings.php
cp default.services.yml services.yml
mkdir files/
chmod a+w *


Create virtual host for drupal8 folder. I have created http://drupal8.local

http://drupal8.local. if things work fine you will see installation page

Drupal was complaining I do not have gd module installed, so I ran sudo apt install php-gd


After following setup I did
cd /var/www/html/drupal8/sites/
sudo chmod 555 default/
cd default
sudo chmod 444 settings.php


I noticed that Drupal install was giving me a warning saying my clean urls were not enabled. But they were actually enabled. But I still tried doing sudo a2enmod rewrite # apache confirmed it was already enabled

But I still got error when I would try to access pages like drupal8.local/admin/config

Then I found an article saying a link like drupal8.local/index.php/admin/config will work. I gave it a try and it was working.

So I created a .htaccess file in /var/www/html/drupal8 directory with the following content, and things seemed to work
RewriteEngine On
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d
RewriteRule ^ index.php [QSA,L]


// Todo: still i see the admin menu adds index.php to the link
