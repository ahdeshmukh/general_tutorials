UBUNTU APACHE CREATE VIRTUAL HOSTS

Assumption - Apache is installed. Since we are going to create .php files, I am assuming that php is also installed. It is better to install the LAMP Stack

SETUP
*Go to /var/www/html and create 2 folders test1 and test2
*These folders are owned by root user. If we want regular user to modify the files in web directory, we should run the below commands. $USER variable is value of user you are currently logged in
sudo chown -R $USER:$USER /var/www/html/test1
sudo chown -R $USER:$USER /var/www/html/test2
*We should also modify our permissions a little bit to ensure that read access is permitted to the general web directory and all of the files and folders it contains so that pages can be served correctly:
sudo chmod -R 755 /var/www
*create file index.php in test1 and test2. make sure the contents in index.php file help us easily identify which folder it belongs to


CREATE VIRTUAL HOSTS
cd /etc/apache2/sites-available

sudo cp 000-default.conf test1.local.conf
sudo vi test1.local.conf
Change ServerAdmin to admin@example.com, ServerName to test1.local and DocumentRoot to /var/www/html/test1. Save test1.local.conf and exit

sudo cp test1.local.conf test2.local.conf
sudo vi test2.local.conf
Change ServerAdmin to admin@example.com, ServerName to test2.local and DocumentRoot to /var/www/html/test2. Save test2.local.conf and exit

ENABLE VIRTUAL HOSTS
sudo a2ensite test1.local.conf
sudo a2ensite test2.local.conf
* Disable the default site defined in 000-default.conf
sudo a2dissite 000-default.conf

RESTART APACHE
* Use sudo systemctl restart apache2 or sudo service apache2 restart

SETUP LOCAL HOSTS
sudo vi /etc/hosts
*Add a new line 
127.0.0.1	test1.local test2.local
save and close /etc/hosts

TRY YOUR RESULTS
Open a browser and type http://test1.local and http://test2.local. If everything is fine you should see these two different websites loading up.
