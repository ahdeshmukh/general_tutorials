Assumptions

My files are located in C:\Users\Amit\Desktop\python-projects\udemy-python\flask directory
Virtual environment is created in the flask folder using python -m venv virtual, which creates a virtual folder inside of the flask folder



1) Create an account on Heroku
2) Download and install Heroku toolbelt for windows. make sure you add Heroku to path during installation
3) cd C:\Users\Amit\Desktop\python-projects\udemy-python\flask\virtual\Scripts
4) activate
5) open a command terminal and cd C:\Users\Amit\Desktop\python-projects\udemy-python\flask\files
6) heroku login (provide credentials)
7) heroku create flask-deshmukh-ah (it creates an app on heroku that you can visit at https://flask-deshmukh-ah.herokuapp.com/)
8) pip install gunicorn (needed by heroku server to run the web application)
9) pip freeze > requirements.txt
10) Create a file and name it Procfile (make sure it does not have any extensions)
11) Open Procfile using notepad and add web: gunicorn _init_:app (it tells gunicorn to run _init_.py file and app is the name of variable we used to declare Flask app = Flask(__name__) )
12) Create file runtime.txt and add python-3.6.1 to it. It tells heroku which version of python to run. At the time of writing this, Heroku supported 3.6.1 (https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/python-support#supported-python-runtimes)
13) Since I had already pushed my code to a github repository, I had to add Heroku app's git repository that was created when I created the app using heroku git:remote -a flask-deshmukh-ah
14) push to heroku using git push heroku master
