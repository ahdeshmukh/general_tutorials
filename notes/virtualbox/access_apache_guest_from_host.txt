http://askubuntu.com/questions/52147/how-can-i-access-apache-on-virtualbox-guest-from-host

I installed Apache on an Ubuntu VM. When I go into the guest and load up Firefox I can see that Apache is working fine when I browse to localhost.

I would like to access this same page through the host. I've tried using the IP address of the guest but nothing comes up. 

Ideally I would love to set up my Windows 7 (host) to request http://guestserver.com of the Apache server on the guest. How can I do this?


ANSWER

Stop your VM and open its settings in the VirtualBox (OSE) Manager
Go to the Network tab
Select the network mode at your choice (bridged networking or host-only) (in the below example, I'm using host-only)

If you want to use bridged networking, you've to select the right network adapter at Name. For wired connections, you'd select something named like eth0. Wireless connections are usually named wlan0 (the numbers may vary)
Save the settings
Start the Ubuntu VM
When up, you can gather the IP address by running:
ifconfig | grep addr
Output would be
eth0  Link encap:Ethernet  HWaddr 08:00:27:70:27:fe  
      inet addr:192.168.56.101  Bcast:192.168.56.255  Mask:255.255.255.0
      inet6 addr: fe80::a00:27ff:fe7b:25fe/64 Scope:Link
      inet addr:127.0.0.1  Mask:255.0.0.0
      inet6 addr: ::1/128 Scope:Host

We can use 192.168.56.101 in the windows C:\Windows\drivers\etc\hosts file
You can add entries to hosts file like 
192.168.56.101	test1.guest.local test2.guest.local 
where test1.guest.local, test2.guest.local are virtual hosts in the Guest ubuntu system
