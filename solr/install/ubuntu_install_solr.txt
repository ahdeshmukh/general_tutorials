cd ~
wget http://apache.claz.org/lucene/solr/6.1.0/solr-6.1.0.tgz
tar xzf solr-6.1.0.tgz solr-6.1.0/bin/install_solr_service.sh --strip-components=2
sudo bash ./install_solr_service.sh solr-6.1.0.tgz
sudo service solr status

To access solr, go to http://localhost:8983/solr

Solr commands (make sure the current user has sudo priviliges, otherwise you will get an error)
start => sudo service solr start
stop => sudo service solr stop
restart => sudo service solr restart

By default, the service installation script will extract the distribution archive into /opt. Location of solr folder and files /opt/solr. The script creates a symlink called solr in /opt. The structure of /opt looks like 
/opt/solr-6.1.0
/opt/solr -> /opt/solr-6.1.0

Separate Directory for Writable Files
You should also separate writable Solr files into a different directory; by default, the installation script uses /var/solr, but you can override this location using the -d option. With this approach, the files in /opt/solr will remain untouched and all files that change while Solr is running will live under /var/solr.

Create the Solr user
Running Solr as root is not recommended for security reasons. Consequently, you should determine the username of a system user that will own all of the Solr files and the running Solr process. By default, the installation script will create a new user "solr", but you can override this setting using the -u option. If your organization has specific requirements for creating new user accounts, then you should create the user before running the script. The installation script will make the Solr user the owner of the /opt/solr and /var/solr directories.

If you are not logged in as "solr" user, you may not be allowed to run commands to create core, since the /var/solr directory is owned by solr user. I did not take a note of the password, that got created  for the solr user. So I logged in as root user and then reset the password of the solr user as follows
sudo -s (logs you as root user)
passwd solr (will ask you to create and confirm the new password for solr user)
exit
whoami
su - solr (enter the password for solr user that you just reset)
whoami (you should now be logged in as solr user)
cd /var/solr (you should be able to cd to /var/solr now)

Gettin started with some commands. Run this command in ths solr directory
cd /opt/solr (making sure we are in solr directory)
bin/solr status (gives status of solr. try issuing sudo service solr stop and then running the bin/solr status)
