All these commands will be run in /opt/solr unless stated otherwise. Make sure you are logged in as a user that has permissions to modify /var/solr directory. I am logged as user "solr" since that was the user that got created when I installed solr. (Ref installation/ubuntu_install_solr.txt)

CREATE CORE
bin/solr create -c gettingstarted (creates a core called gettingstarted)
This command will create a folder called gettingstarted inside /var/solr/data

POST DATA
bin/post -c gettingstarted example/exampledocs/*.xml (indexes all the .xml files from example/exampledocs)

DELETE CORE
bin/solr delete -c gettingstarted (deletes gettingstarted core)
